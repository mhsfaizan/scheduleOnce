      <tr>
        <th>Components</th>

      <tr>
        <td>1.Components define views, which are sets of screen elements that Angular can choose among and modify
          according to your program logic and data.
          Every Angular application has at least one component, the root component that connects a component hierarchy
          with the page document object model (DOM). Each component defines a class that contains application data and
          logic, and is associated with an HTML template that defines a view to be displayed in a target environment.
        </td>
        <td>1.
          Service is a broad category encompassing any value, function, or feature that an app needs. A service is
          typically a class with a narrow, well-defined purpose. It should do something specific and do it well.

          Angular distinguishes components from services to increase modularity and reusability. By separating a
          component's view-related functionality from other kinds of processing, you can make your component classes
          lean and efficient.</td>
        <td>1.Marks a class as an Angular directive. You can define your own directives to attach custom behavior to
          elements in the DOM. The options provide configuration metadata that determines how the directive should be
          processed, instantiated and used at runtime.</td>
        <td>1.Angular NgModules differ from and complement JavaScript (ES2015) modules. An NgModule declares a
          compilation context for a set of components that is dedicated to an application domain, a workflow, or a
          closely related set of capabilities. An NgModule can associate its components with related code, such as
          services, to form functional units.</td>
        <td>1.Models in Angular; using objects which hold your data may be pretty useful. It makes the developer live
          significantly easier - so let me show you what I'm talking about and how I handle models in Angular.<br/>
